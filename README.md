Cloud Application Security

Cloud application security is a series of defined policies, processes, controls, and technology governing all information that protect software deployed in the cloud. Protecting cloud-based applications with network and infrastructure security is no longer enough, and most organizations leverage application-level security measures as well.

Cloud application security measures are usually implemented during software development and after applications are deployed. This comprehensive approach is the best way to prevent security incidents from negatively impacting the organizationâ€™s reputation and revenue.
